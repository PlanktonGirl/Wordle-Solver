# Wordle-Solver
A little program I wrote for when I'm Wordling and get stuck

The program was built in Python 3

This program takes the Wordle list of answers and the list of allowed guesses, lets you enter the letters you know and the letters you've eliminated, and searches the two word lists and only returns the words that fit your criteria. 

This is fundametally a brute force linear search since it has to look through every word in the word lists. But it does its job very well.

At some point, I may build out code to accept user inputs. Right now, the version I've uploaded requires you to enter the info directly in the three lists/arrays. I've made abundant notes within the code, but this version does assume you have some programming experience and can enter the data in the right format.
