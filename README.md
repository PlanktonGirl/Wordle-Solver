# Wordle-Solver
This started as a "for fun" project, but became a portfolio project for a DSA class

This is a linear search algorithm with a O(N) runtime since it has to check every word in the lists one time.

The program was built in Python 3

This program takes the Wordle list of answers and the list of allowed guesses, lets you enter the letters you know and the letters you've eliminated, and searches the two word lists and only returns the words that fit your criteria. 

There are two versions of the program. One is just the search algorithm, and is for people who know Python 3 and are able to enter the letters and positions directly into the lists/arrays.

There is another version that runs like an application and accepts the letters and positions as input.

Happy Wordling!
